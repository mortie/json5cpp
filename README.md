# Json5Cpp

Json5Cpp is a small header-only library to parse and serialize
[JSON5](https://json5.org/),
built on top of [JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp).
Like JsonCpp, it requires C++11.

The API is simple, just one function to parse and one function to serialize.

## Parsing

```c++
struct Json5::ParseConfig {
    // Whether or not to enforce a ',' between object/array elements.
    // Note: Setting this to 'false' enables invalid JSON5.
    bool mandatoryCommas = true;

    // The maximum parse depth, to avoid unbounded recursion.
    int maxDepth = 100;
};

bool Json5::parse(
    std::istream &, Json::Value &,
    std::string *err = nullptr, Json5::ParseConfig conf = {});
```

It returns `true` on success, `false` on error.
If an error occurs, the string pointed to by `err` will be filled with an error message,
if it's not null.

## Serializing

```c++
struct Json5::SerializeConfig {
    // Whether or not to add a trailing ',' after the last element
    // of an object/array.
    bool trailingCommas = true;

    // Whether or not to omit quotes in keys when possible.
    bool bareKeys = true;

    // The string used for each level of nesting.
    // Set to 'nullptr' to avoid whitespace completely.
    const char *indent = "\t";
};

void Json5::serialize(
    std::ostream &, const Json::Value &,
    Json5::SerializeConfig conf = {}, int depth = 0);
```

Since it doesn't return a status, it's up to the calling code
to check whether the `bad` bit is set on the output stream.

## Examples

Here's a minimal program which reads JSON5 from stdin and writes JSON to stdout:

```c++
#include <json5cpp/json5cpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Json::Value value;
    std::string err;
    if (Json5::parse(std::cin, value, &err)) {
        std::cout << value << '\n';
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Invalid JSON5: " << err << '\n';
    }
}
```

And here's the opposite,
a program which reads JSON from stdin and writes JSON5 to stdout:

```c++
#include <json5cpp/json5cpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Json::Value value;
    std::string err;
    std::cin >> value;
    Json5::serialize(std::cout, value);
    std::cout << '\n';
}
```

For a slightly bigger example, this repo contains a `json5-to-json` example program
which reads JOSN5 files and outputs JSON:
[examples/json5-to-json.cc](./examples/json5-to-json.cc).
There's also a `json-to-json5` example program which reads JSON files
and outputs JSON5:
[examples/json-to-json5.cc](./examples/json-to-json5.cc).

Here's an example JSON5 document which showcases some of its features
(stolen from [json5.org](https://json5.org/)):

```json5
{
  // comments
  unquoted: 'and you can quote me on that',
  singleQuotes: 'I can use "double quotes" here',
  lineBreaks: "Look, Mom! \
No \\n's!",
  hexadecimal: 0xdecaf,
  leadingDecimalPoint: .8675309, andTrailing: 8675309.,
  positiveSign: +1,
  trailingComma: 'in objects', andIn: ['arrays',],
  "backwardsCompatible": "with JSON",
}
```

## Tests

Run tests with: `make check`. This depends on git, npm and node.

The test suite consists of the
[JSON Parsing Test Suite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite), the
[JSON5 test suite](https://github.com/json5/json5-tests), and a couple custom tests.
The test script validates Json5Cpp's output against JavaScript's `JSON.parse`
for all JSON files in the test set, and against the JSON5 reference implementation
for all JSON5 files in the set.

There are currently 177 test JSON and JSON5 files.
All tests pass.

## Benchmarks

Run benchmarks with: `make bench`.

The benchmarking suite compares Json5Cpp against
[JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) and
[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
In my testing, Json5Cpp turns out a bit faster than JsonCpp across the board,
and trades blows with nlohmann/json.

These benchmarks aren't very robust, don't take them as a reliable statement about the
absolute performance of the different JSON parsers.
However, they serve as a sanity check to make sure Json5Cpp isn't doing something stupid.

Here's a typical run on my AMD R9 5950X:

```
Benchmark 'Tiny':
Json5Cpp: 88ns
JsonCpp:  1924ns
Nlohmann: 124ns

Benchmark 'Big Nested String Array':
Json5Cpp: 55ms
JsonCpp:  60ms
Nlohmann: 37ms

Benchmark 'Big Object Of Numbers':
Json5Cpp: 15ms
JsonCpp:  22ms
Nlohmann: 31ms

Benchmark 'GitHub REST Response':
Json5Cpp: 2906ns
JsonCpp:  5811ns
Nlohmann: 5007ns
```

And a typical run on my Apple M1 Pro:

```
Benchmark 'Tiny':
Json5Cpp: 82ns
JsonCpp:  1599ns
Nlohmann: 139ns

Benchmark 'Big Nested String Array':
Json5Cpp: 43ms
JsonCpp:  53ms
Nlohmann: 30ms

Benchmark 'Big Object Of Numbers':
Json5Cpp: 21ms
JsonCpp:  38ms
Nlohmann: 22ms

Benchmark 'GitHub REST Response':
Json5Cpp: 3268ns
JsonCpp:  6960ns
Nlohmann: 3920ns
```

Feel free to contribute more benchmarks.

## Fuzzing

Install [AFLplusplus](https://aflplus.plus/) (`sudo apt install afl++` on Ubuntu),
then run `make fuzz` to start fuzzing.

By default, 20 fuzzer processes will start.
You can change this in the [fuzz.sh](./fuzz.sh) script.

I've ran the fuzzer against `Json5::parse` for quite a while on beefy machines,
and no issues have been found.

## JSON5 Incompatibilities

Json5Cpp should correctly parse all valid JSON5 documents.
However, it will also accept some documents which the JSON5 spec would consider invalid.

* Json5Cpp assumes, but doesn't validate, that the input is UTF-8.
  If the input isn't valid UTF-8, the parsed JSON tree won't necessarily be valid UTF-8.
  Use a separate UTF-8 validation library if that's a problem.
* Identifiers are supposed to only be able to start with non-ASCII characters in the Unicode classes
  "Uppercase letter", "Lowercase letter", "Titlecase letter", "Modifier letter", "Other letter"
  or "Letter number". Subsequent letters are constrained to those classes plus a couple more.
  Json5Cpp doesn't contain a Unicode database, and will accept identifiers which start with
  or contain all non-whitespace non-ASCII characters.

If you encounter any valid JSON5 documents which Json5Cpp doesn't correctly parse,
please do file a bug.
I've done my best to implement the parser according to the spec,
and Json5Cpp passes the [json5-test suite](https://github.com/json5/json5-tests)
(and the [JSONTestSuite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite)),
but bugs might of course have sneaked in.
